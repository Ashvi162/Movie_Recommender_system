# Movie_Recommender_system
**Movie Recommender System Dataset - README**

**💡 Overview**

This repository contains a dataset and analysis for building a **movie recommender system**. The project explores user preferences, ratings, and movie metadata to develop recommendation algorithms using techniques such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

**🎯 Objectives**

- Analyze user-movie interactions to understand preferences.
- Develop and evaluate recommendation models.
- Provide actionable insights into user behavior and movie trends.

**📂 Dataset Information**

- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Size**: 4809,23
- **Features**:
  - Movie_ID: Unique identifier for each movie.
  - Movie_Title: Title of the movie.
  - Genre: Categories of the movie (e.g., Action, Drama).
  - Director, Actors: Metadata about the movie.
  - Overview of the movie
  - Release_Year: Year the movie was released.

**🛠️ Tools and Techniques**

- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Surprise, TensorFlow (for deep learning models).
- **Methods**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and outliers.
  - Collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based).
  - Content-based filtering (metadata-driven recommendations).
  - Matrix factorization (e.g., SVD, NMF) and deep learning approaches.

**📊 Key Insights from EDA**

1. **Top Genres**: \[E.g., Action and Drama are the most popular genres\].
2. **User Trends**: \[E.g., Majority of users rate less than 50 movies\].
3. **Movie Trends**: \[E.g., Movies from the early 2000s received higher average ratings\].

**🚀 How to Use**

1. Clone the repository:
2. git clone <https://github.com/your-repo/movie-recommender-system.git>
3. cd movie-recommender-system
4. Install dependencies:
5. pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Explore the dataset and EDA:  
    Open Movie_Recommender_EDA.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Colab.
7. Build and evaluate recommendation models:  
    Use Recommender_System.ipynb for building models and testing results.

**🚀 Future Work**

- Integrate advanced recommendation models (e.g., neural collaborative filtering, Transformers).
- Explore hybrid recommendation techniques.
- Add user demographic features to improve personalization.
- Deploy a web application for real-time recommendations.
